Burn Signal is an open and collaborative project that seeks to reward its contributors fairly relative to one-and-other given an environment of uncertain and inconsistent funding.

As such, we have implemented the following contribution guidelines to help ensure that all rewards are priced using the same mechanism.

Bear in mind that this is a living document and will evolve over time. Feel free to make a pull request for if you think it should be changed in some way.

# Overview
Burn Signal's project management takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/burnsignal) and we use a [colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn) to manage Burn Signal's funds and to track and reward contributors.

Contributors are autonomous in so far as they self-select as contributors and then self-assign, define, price, and work on tasks for Burn Signal.

Burn Signal operates on a novel funding model. We aim to reward all contributions with non-transferable ðŸ”¥ðŸ§§ tokens on a 1:1 ratio with the equivalent USD value of their work.

Upon hitting milestones, the first of which is releasing the PoC version of our [app](https://github.com/burnsignal/burnsignal), the [Burn Signal colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn) will deposit a percentage of its grant funding into its rewards pot. It will then distribute the contents of its rewards pot to members, proportional to their ðŸ”¥ðŸ§§ and reputation balances, using Colony's rewards distribution mechanism.

In this way, participants can be sure that they are getting a fair share of future funding, relative to other contributors, without Burn Signal needing to have capital on hand to pay people upfront or having to know precisely how much future funding it will receive.

# How to Contribute
## Find something to work on
Check out the projects and issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/burnsignal).

If you find something that you would like to contribute to, leave a comment so everyone knows you are working on it and get to work!

## Create something to work on
If you can't find anything that suits your skill-set or interests, then feel free to create a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/BurnerVote) or suggest a task in the [colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn).

Contributors are free to self-select and contribute in any way they see fit.

However, the admins of the [Burn Signal colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn) will have final discretion on whether or not, and how much, funding is allocated to any particular contribution. Generally, the admins will take into account the consensus of other Burn Signal contributors when making decisions fund allocation decisions.

As such, it is good practice to gauge the consensus for the value of a particular contribution prior to committing work to it. Bring it up on our [Telegram](https://t.me/burnsignal) or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/BurnerVote) and encourage people to discuss the idea before you dive headfirst into it.

## Price your work
We aim to reward all contributions with non-transferable ðŸ”¥ðŸ§§ tokens on a 1:1 ratio with the equivalent USD value of their work.

Feel free to price your work however you like; by the hour, by deliverable, by word, or whatever else makes sense for your work. Bearing in mind that these prices are fully transparent (to the world and to the other contributors) and there is no guarantee that the Burn Signal team will accept your price.

If you price your working competitively and inline with the norms of other similar work for the project, then it is likely that it will be approved without issue.

However, if anyone objects to your price, the rest of the contributors will decide on what they think is fair compensation for the work.

## Creating your task in Colony
Start by suggesting a task in the suggestions tab of the [Burn Signal colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn).
When your suggestion is accepted by an admin, it a corresponding task will be created and assigned to you (or the person who will do the work).

Once the admins are comfortable with you as a contributor, they will grant you the `administration` permission in whichever domains you are contributing, which will allow you to autonomously create tasks with whatever level of granularity makes sense for you. Please keep in mind the time and gas costs for the admins that need to review and finalize your tasks.


## Raise an objection
Anyone is free, and should feel empowered, to raise an objection to any work suggestion. If you think that a piece of work is out of scope or priced incorrectly, raise an objection to it in our [Telegram](https://t.me/burnsignal) or the associated github issue.
