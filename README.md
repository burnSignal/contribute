Burn Signal is an open and collaborative project that seeks to reward its contributors relatively fairly given an environment of uncertain and inconsistent funding.
As such, we have implemented the following contribution guidelines to help ensure that all rewards are priced using the same mechanism.

Bear in mind, this is a wiki post that can be edited by all users and will evolve over time as the Burn Signal colony matures.

# Overview
Burn Signal's project management takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/BurnSignal) and the [forum](upload://cGNtN56bh16k02KPm7UmDBntWVp.png).
Burn Signal makes use of a [colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn) to manage its funding and reward contributors.

Contributors are close to autonomous in so far as they self-select as contributors and then self-assign, define, price, and work on tasks for Burn Signal.

Burn Signal operates on a novel funding model. We aim to reward all contributions with non-transferable ðŸ”¥ðŸ§§ tokens on a 1:1 ratio with the equivalent USD value of their work.

Upon hitting milestones, the first of which is the [MVP launch](https://github.com/orgs/BurnerVote/projects/1), the [Burn Signal colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn) will deposit some predefined percentage of its working capital into its rewards pot. It will then distribute the contents of its rewards pot to members, proportional to their ðŸ”¥ðŸ§§ and reputation balances, using Colony's rewards distribution mechanism.

In this way, participants can be sure that they are getting a relatively fair share of future funding, without Burn Signal having to have capital on hand to pay people upfront or having to know precisely how much future funding it will receive.

# How to Contribute
## Find something to work on
Check out the projects and issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/BurnerVote) or scour the topics in the Meta category of the [forum](https://forum.burnsignal.io/c/meta).

If you find something that you would like to contribute to, leave a comment so everyone knows you are working on it and get to work!

## Create something to work on
If you can't find anything that suits your skill-set or interests, then feel free to create a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/BurnerVote) or topic on the [forum](upload://cGNtN56bh16k02KPm7UmDBntWVp.png).

Contributors are free to self-select and contribute in any way they see fit.

However, the admins of the [Burn Signal colony](https://colony.io/colony/burn) will have final discretion on whether or not, and how much, funding is allocated to any particular contribution. Generally, the admins will take into account the consensus of other Burn Signal contributors when making decisions fund allocation decisions.

As such, it is good practice to gauge the consensus for the value of a particular contribution prior to committing work to it. Bring it up on [GitHub](https://github.com/BurnerVote) by creating an issue or the [forum](upload://cGNtN56bh16k02KPm7UmDBntWVp.png) by creating a topic and encourage people to discuss the idea before you dive headfirst into it.

## Price your work
Feel free to price your work however you like; by the hour, by deliverable, by word, or whatever else makes sense for your work. Bearing in mind, that these prices are fully transparent (to the world and to the other contributors) and there is no guarantee that the Burn Signal team will accept your price.

If you price your working competitively and inline with the norms of other similar work for the project, then it is likely that it will be approved without issue.

However, if anyone objects to your price, the rest of the contributors will decide on what they think is fair compensation for the work.

## Creating your task in Colony
If you don't already have a personal domain in the colony, ask an admin to create one for you.
They will give you the `administration` permission in this domain, which will allow you to autonomously create tasks with whatever level of granularity makes sense for you. Bearing in mind the time and gas costs for the admins that need to review and finalize your tasks.


Navigate to your personal domain in the colony, and hit the new task button.

Allocate the task to yourself, write a description (including a price and any relevant links).

Request that one of the admins review it, assign funds, and finalize it by tagging them in the comments.

Once the work is complete and if there are no objections, the task will be finalized.

## Raise an objection
Anyone is free, and should feel empowered, to raise an objection to any work suggestion. If you think that a piece of work is out of scope or priced incorrectly, raise an objection to it in #meta:objections.
